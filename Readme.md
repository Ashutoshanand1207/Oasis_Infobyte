This is repository for my internship in Oasis Infobyte a sofyware development company.
During this intership I have been given 3 Tasks and in this repo you can find all those 3 tasks.

Task 1 : [Landing page]()

The landing page I designed for my internship at Oasis Infobyte! I created a dynamic home page for a car dealership,
featuring animations and HTML/CSS wizardry. The dynamic home page for a car dealership is a testament to our creative approach to web design. 

Task 2 : [Portfolio]()

Delighted to present my portfolio website, a result of my internship at Oasis Infobyte. 

Task 3 : [Temprature Convertor]()

A temperature converter project I developed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. This handy tool allows you to seamlessly convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
